### Intro

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a basic RESTful API that will be used for managing a cards dataset. The API will support the normal CRUD operations on the data (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). This project will be written in TypeScript, and we will be using the following frameworks:

  - Express
  - Inversify

As we develop our project, we will start off by storing our cards data in memory, and then we will switch to using an external data store. As part of the tutorial, we will we show you how to use dependency injection to manage the dependencies in our code, and will we also be creating unit tests for our code as we go along.

You can find the complete code for this tutorial here: <a href="TODO" target="_blank">GitHub - TODO</a>.
